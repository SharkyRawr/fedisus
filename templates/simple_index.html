<h1>FediSus<small> - trying to find suspect fediverse instances</small></h1>

<p><strong>Last update: {{last_update}}</strong></p>

<p>Number of instances scraped successfully: {{stats.numinstances}}</p>
<p>Number of instances with MRF policies set: {{stats.nummrf}}</p>
<p>Number of instances with MRF <i>reject</i> set: {{stats.numreject}}</p>

<p>Please remember that this is data is scraped from a single source of instance-to-instance interactions: my instance.
    There are a lot more instances that don't show up because I'm just not in indirect contact with anyone on them.<br>
    I will work on trying to scrape a more complete image of the fediverse in the future. For now I sleep. <img src="https://pleroma.catgirl.biz/emoji/blobfox/blobfoxsleep.png" style="width:32px;height:32px;vertical-align: text-bottom;">

<h2>MRF reject popularity:<br><small>Not showing instances that were blocked only once!</small></h2>
<p>This is also available in JSON: <a href="{{ url_for('rejects_json')}}">/rejects.json</a></p>
<p><small>Apparently its cool to hate on these guys (remember that instances may be blocked for legit and illegitimate reasons, cast your own judgement):</small></p>
<ul>
    {% for rp, n in reject_popularity.items() %}
